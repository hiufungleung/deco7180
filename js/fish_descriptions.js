    "australian-salmon": "Arripis is a genus of marine fishes from Australia and New Zealand, known as Australian salmon, kahawai and Australian herring. They are the only members of the family Arripidae. Despite the common name, Australian salmon are not related to the salmon family Salmonidae of the Northern Hemisphere, just as Australian herring are not related to herring of the Northern Hemisphere, but belong to the order Perciformes of perch-like fishes. Australian salmon were named so by early European settlers after their superficial resemblance to the salmoniform fishes.",
    "barracouta": "A barracuda is a large, predatory, ray-finned fish known for its fearsome appearance and ferocious behaviour. The barracuda is a saltwater fish of the genus Sphyraena, the only genus in the family Sphyraenidae, which was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. It is found in tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide ranging from the eastern border of the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, on its western border the Caribbean Sea, and in tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean. Barracudas reside near the top of the water and near coral reefs and sea grasses. Barracudas are targeted by sport-fishing enthusiasts.",
    "bass": "The Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata) is a small- to medium-sized species of primarily freshwater(but estuarine spawning) fish found in coastal rivers and streams along the east coast of Australia. A member of the genus Macquaria (although some researchers place it in the genus Percalates instead) from the family Percichthyidae (temperate perches), the Australian bass is an important member of the native fish assemblages found in east coast river systems. It is a native predatory fish and an extremely popular game fish species among anglers. The species was simply called perch in most coastal rivers where it was caught until the 1960s, when the name \"Australian bass\" started to gain popularity.",
    "bluefin-tuna": "The southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) is a tuna of the family Scombridae found in open southern Hemisphere waters of all the world's oceans mainly between 30°S and 50°S, to nearly 60°S. They are also found in ponds within regions of Southern Ontario. At up to 2.5 metres and weighing up to 260 kilograms, it is among the larger bony fishes. Southern bluefin tuna, like other pelagic tuna species, are part of a group of bony fishes that can maintain their body core temperature up to 10 °C above the ambient temperature. This advantage enables them to maintain high metabolic output for predation and migrating large distances. The southern bluefin tuna is an opportunistic feeder, preying on a wide variety of fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, salps, and other marine animals.",
    "bream": "The common bream (Abramis brama), also known as the freshwater bream, bream, bronze bream, carp bream or sweaty bream, is a European species of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is now considered to be the only species in the genus Abramis.  The common bream's home range is Europe north of the Alps and Pyrenees, as well as the Balkans. They are found as far east as the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, and the Aral Sea. The common bream lives in ponds, lakes, canals, and slow-flowing rivers. The bream is usually 30 to 55 cm long, though some specimens of 75 cm have been recorded; it usually weighs 2 to 4 kg. Its maximum length is 90 cm, the record weight exceeds 9 kg. The common bream has a laterally flattened and high-backed body and a slightly undershot mouth. It has a bright silver colouration, though older fish can be bronze-coloured, especially in clear waters. The fins are greyish to black, but never reddish. The common bream generally lives in rivers (especially in the lower reaches) and in nutrient-rich lakes and ponds with muddy bottoms and plenty of algae. It can also be found in brackish sea waters.",
    "bronze-whaler-shark": "The copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), bronze whaler, or narrowtooth shark is a species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, found mostly at temperate latitudes. It is distributed in a number of separate populations in the northeastern and southwestern Atlantic, off southern Africa, in the northwestern and eastern Pacific, and around Australia and New Zealand, with scattered reports from equatorial regions. This species can be found from brackish rivers and estuaries, to shallow bays and harbors, to offshore waters 100 m deep or more. Females are found apart from males for most of the year, and conduct seasonal migrations. A large species reaching 3.3 m long, the copper shark is difficult to distinguish from other large requiem sharks. It is characterized by its narrow, hook-shaped upper teeth, lack of a prominent ridge between the dorsal fins, and plain bronze coloration. The copper shark is the only member of its genus largely found in temperate rather than tropical waters, in temperatures above 12 °C. It is widely distributed but as disjunct regional populations with little to no interchange between them. The copper shark has a slender, streamlined body with a slightly arched profile just behind the head. The pectoral fins are large, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The first dorsal fin is tall, with a pointed apex and a concave trailing margin; its origin lies about even with the tips of the pectoral fins. ",
    "brown-trout": "The brown trout (Salmo trutta) is a species of salmonid fish that is widely distributed in Europe and West Asia and has been widely introduced globally. The lacustrine morph of brown trout is most usually potamodromous, migrating from lakes into rivers or streams to spawn. Defining characteristics include a slender body with a long, narrow head. The mouth is large, and on its roof, vomerine teeth are developed in a zig-zag pattern. The caudal fin is deltaform without forking, unlike that of the related Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Dark and red spots are often present on the sides, but do not extend to the tail. Freshwater brown trout range in colour from largely silver with relatively few spots and a white belly, to the more well-known brassy reddish-brown cast fading to creamy white on the fish's belly, with medium-sized spots surrounded by lighter halos.",
    "elephant-fish": "Elephant fish are a funny-looking fish with an almost entirely scaleless elongated body. They have large pectoral fins and two dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is preceded by a large spine. Elephant fish have a single gill opening immediately in front of the pectoral fin on each side of the fish. The snout is covered in pores that sense movement and weak electrical fields, which are used in detecting prey. Ghost sharks are silvery with dark markings, with a hoe-shaped proboscis-like snout. Its Size  is Up to about 1.2 metres in length and 7 kg. Females grow larger than males. their’s life span is Up to about 15 years for ghost sharks. Ghost sharks are often found in shallow bays and large estuaries, but also to depths of 200 metres on the continental shelf. ",
    "estuary-perch": "it has Forked tail and Concave (hollow) head profile. Fairly long, tapered snout. Eye is moderately large. Large, oblique mouth, with the gape reaching to below the middle of the eye. Lower jaw protrudes. Moderate scales which are also on the cheeks and gill covers. Prominent lateral line. Black to dark grey or olive-green, silvery on the back, becoming lighter on the sides. Whitish or silvery belly. Sometimes has purplish or reddish tints on the head. All fins are dark coloured, often with a greenish tinge. This species can grow up to 10 kg, but is commonly much smaller, usual weight range being 400 g - 2 kg. Appears to prefer more saline and deeper water than Australian bass, but moves regularly into freshwater. Spawning occurs in the mouths of estuaries in salt water during July and August when water temperatures are between 14 and 19°C.",
    "flathead": "A flathead is one of a number of small to medium fish species with notably flat heads, distributed in membership across various genera of the family Platycephalidae. Flathead are notable for their unusual body shape, which their hunting strategy is based upon. Flathead are dorsally compressed, meaning their body is wide but flattened and very low in height. Both eyes are on the top of the flattened head, giving excellent binocular vision to attack overhead prey. The effect is somewhat similar to flounders. In contrast to flounder, however, flathead are much more elongated, the tail remains vertical, and the mouth is large, wide and symmetrical. Flathead have two short spikes on either side of their heads and on top of their heads that contain venom. The venom, while not fatal, can cause pain and infection for no more than about 2 days. ",
    "flounder": "Flounders are a group of flatfish species. They are demersal fish, found at the bottom of oceans around the world; some species will also enter estuaries. Larval flounder are born with one eye on each side of their head, but as they grow from the larval to juvenile stage through metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the other side of the body. As a result, both eyes are then on the side which faces up. The side to which the eyes migrate is dependent on the species type. As an adult, a flounder changes its habits and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor as protection against predators. A flounder's diet consists mainly of fish spawn, crustaceans, polychaetes and small fish. Flounder typically grow to a length of 22–60 centimeters, and as large as 95 centimeters. Their width is about half their length.",
    "garfish": "The garfish (Belone belone), also known as the garpike or sea needle. The garfish is a long and slender fish with a laterally compressed body, and grows to about 50 to 75 cm in length. The jaws are elongated and armed with sharp teeth. Positioning the fins so far back gives greater flexibility to the body. The lateral line is set low on the flanks. The colour of the body is bluish green with a silvery grey belly and the bones are green. The garfish is a predator which hunts in the open sea seeking out shoals of small fish such as Atlantic herring, sprats, sand eels, and even three-spined sticklebacks. They also feed on free-swimming crustaceans. Garfish are oviparous and the eggs are often found attached to objects in the water by tendrils on the egg's surface. Spawning occurs in May and June among seagrass beds with the long sticky tendrils on the chorion adhering to the blades of the sea grasses. ",
    "gummy-shark": "The gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus), also known as the Australian smooth hound, flake, sweet williamor smooth dog-shark, is a shark in the family Triakidae. These small to medium-sized bottom-dwelling sharks are found mostly in, but are not limited to, the area around the southern seas of Australia. This species is a slender shark with a darker grey top with white spots and a silvery-white underbelly. The gummy shark gets its name from its flat, plate-like teeth which it uses to crush its shelled and non-shelled prey. The gummy shark feeds on crustaceans, marine worms, small fish, and cephalopods such as octopus, squid and cuttlefish. It uses its plate-like teeth to help it crush the shells and bodies of its prey for easier consumption. The gummy shark remains on or near the sea beds, and their travel patterns vary on age. ",
    "gurnard": "The red gurnard (Chelidonichthys cuculus), also known as the East Atlantic red gurnard or soldier, is a benthic species of ray-finned fish belonging to the family Triglidae, the gurnards and sea robins. This fish is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. The red gurnard has a large angular head which does not have a deep occipital groove but has a steep snout, which is elongated forward with a flattened, two lobed rostrum covered in denticles. The colour is bright red on the upper body, pale on the lower body with pink pelvic fins. The anal fin is white at its base while the pectoral and dorsal fins are yellowish. ",
    "king-george-whiting": "The King George whiting (Sillaginodes punctatus), also known as the spotted whiting or spotted sillago, is a coastal marine fish of the smelt-whitings family Sillaginidae. The King George whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the south coast of the country from Jurien Bay, Western Australia to Botany Bay, New South Wales in the east. The King George whiting has the same overall profile as the rest of the sillaginid fishes, an elongate, slightly compressed body with a tapering head and terminal mouth. In situations where identification is needed quickly, the colour of the King George whiting is also very distinctive, with a pale golden brown to olive brown top colour and white to silver colour on its underside. The species also as distinct obliquely positioned rows of brown spots running the length of its body, which are apparent to see even after removal from the water and after death. The caudal, anal and pectoral fins are usually a light brown, with some having olive green caudal fins.",
    "leatherjacket": "The leatherjacket fish (Oligoplites saurus), also known as leather jack, is a species of jack in the family Carangidae. Several features set Leatherjackets apart from other fish species, these include: a small mouth with beak-like teeth, rough sometimes sandpaper like skin, small gill openings, and a single serrated spine on the top of the head that fits neatly into a groove. There are more than 20 species of Leatherjackets found throughout NSW waters and, depending on the species, can be caught in estuarine, coastal and offshore waters to depths of 250 m or more. In estuarine waters these fish are often found around artificial structures such as pylons and wharfs or are found near seagrass beds e.g. Fan-belly, Six Spine and Rough Leatherjackets. In coastal and offshore areas they can be found on rocky reefs, sand/mud bottom or in sponge beds.",
    "long-finned-pike": "Slender predatory greyish to yellowish-brown fishes becoming silvery below, with a yellow tail, a narrow pointed head, a large eye, a large mouth with a slightly protruding lower jaw, and a single row of small teeth in both jaws. The small first dorsal fin is widely-separated from the larger second dorsal, the anal fin is long-based, and the lateral line is almost straight and continues far onto the tail. Longfin Pike are often seen hovering motionless in schools above the bottom, occasionally in their hundreds.",
    "luderick": "The parore also known as luderick, black bream, black snapper or blackfish is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a sea chub from the family Kyphosidae which is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean off Australia and New Zealand. Parore or paraore is the common name in New Zealand but in Australia luderick is preferred. The parore has a moderately deep, compressed, oval shaped body with a thin caudal peduncle, It has a small head which has a slightly convex forehead, and small eyes. The mouth is small and does not extend as far as the eye. The jaws have an outer row of overlapping, flattened, tricuspid teeth beside a wide band of teeth of similar shape but which are tiny. Much of the body is covered im moderately small ctenoid scales and there is an arched lateral line, made up of 48-51 pored scales, which is parallel to the dorsal profile.",
    "mackerel": "Mackerel is a common name applied to a number of different species of pelagic fish, mostly from the family Scombridae. They are found in both temperate and tropical seas, mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment. Mackerel species typically have deeply forked tails and vertical 'tiger-like' stripes on their backs with an iridescent green-blue quality. Many are restricted in their distribution ranges and live in separate populations or fish stocks based on geography. Some stocks migrate in large schools along the coast to suitable spawning grounds, where they spawn in fairly shallow waters. After spawning they return the way they came in smaller schools to suitable feeding grounds, often near an area of upwelling. From there they may move offshore into deeper waters and spend the winter in relative inactivity. Other stocks migrate across oceans.",
    "marlin": "This large fish with a long, rounded, spear-like upper jaw is available wild-caught. It is a nomadic marine fish found in the open ocean right around the Australian coast; it hunts near the surface, mainly at night. It is caught only as bycatch, mainly by tuna longliners off the east and west coasts. Though similar in appearance to Swordfish it is easily distinguished by its shorter, rounded ‘spear’ and scaled skin.",
    "morwong": "Available wild-caught; it is a bottom-dwelling marine fish that occurs from Brisbane south to Perth, including Bass Strait and around the Tasmanian coast, on the continental shelf and upper slope from shallow waters to depths of between 10 and 400m often near reefs or rocky bottoms, with smaller fish found near the coasts of Victoria and Tasmania. It is mainly caught off south-eastern Australia by demersal trawl, with minor catches in the Great Australian Bight. It is also caught off NSW by traps and droplines. Similar to Grey Morwong but more greyish-white rather than blue, and with a lack of distinctive colouring around the eyes. King Morwong can be distinguished from Jackass by its dark band on the outer upper half of the pectoral fin. Jackass Morwong, and the closely related but far less common King Morwong, are usually sold under the marketing name ‘Morwong’.",
    "mullet": "As general mullet, fish they have a terminal mouth with thick lips, 2 dorsal fins, a lunate homocercal caudal fin (upper lobe and lower lobe are equal length) and do not have a lateral line organ, which is usually used for detecting changes in their surroundings. The cycloid (smooth outer edge) scales of the sand grey mullet fish are thin, flexible and overlapping with a mix of silver and grey color scheme. They are easily identified by their bright yellow eyes. They have a skeleton made of bone and have a streamline body shape for body undulations that allows them to be fast swimmers. Being constant swimmers required large amounts of oxygen which is achieved by water passing over their gills, which are in place of lungs to still have a large surface area through the various grooves in the gill tissue. The oxygen is obtained when they exhale and the water is pushed through their pharynx. Their blood flows in the opposite direction (countercurrent exchange) of the water over the gills in able to remove the maximum amount of oxygen from the water. They use a swim bladder to adjust their buoyancy by changing the volume of gas in the bladder to keep an overall constant volume for the bladder at different depths.",
    "mulloway": "The mulloway is an immensely popular and highly sought-after target species amongst Australian anglers, and this fact is reflected in the number of common and regional names used to describe the fish. These include jewfish, jewie or jew (particularly in NSW and Queensland), river kingfish or river king (WA), and butterfish or mully (SA). Smaller specimens are sometimes called soapies (a reference to their soft flesh), and mid-sized or sub-adult mulloway are commonly referred to as school jewies, especially in the ",
    "prawns": "Penaeus monodon, commonly known as the giant tiger prawn, Asian tiger shrimp, black tiger shrimp, and other names, is a marine crustacean that is widely reared for food. Tiger Prawns are pale brown to bluey green with distinct grey, blue or black stripes; Black Tiger Prawns are the most common aquaculture Prawn in Australia. Brown and Grooved are available wild-caught, while Black and Kuruma are almost exclusively farmed, though Black and Brown are both found around the northern coast of Australia from central NSW to Shark Bay, WA, and Grooved are found from Rockhampton to Augustine, WA. Tiger Prawns are both marine and estuarine, preferring sandy and muddy bottoms in coastal waters usually less than 30m deep, but found at up to 150m. Juveniles are found in estuaries among seagrass and mangroves.",
    "school-shark": "The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) is a houndshark of the familyTriakidae, and the only member of the genus Galeorhinus. Common names also include tope, tope shark, snapper shark, and soupfin shark. It is found worldwide in temperate seas at depths down to about 800 m. It can grow to nearly 2 m long. It feeds both in midwater and near the seabed, and its reproduction is ovoviviparous. This shark is caught in fisheries for its flesh, its fins, and its liver, which has a very high vitamin A content. The IUCN has classified this species as critically endangered in its Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "silver-trevally": "Silver trevally have moderately elongate and compressed bodies. The upper body is bluish silver, with yellowish silver sides and a silver belly. There is a small black blotch on the operculum (the hard bony flap covering the gills). Silver trevally have two dorsal fins, a deeply forked tail fin, and two small detached spines in front of the anal fin. Juveniles and sub-adults usually have a yellow mid-lateral stripe and a faint yellow stripe along the bases of the dorsal and anal fins.",
    "snook": "The common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a species of marine fish in the family Centropomidae of the order Perciformes. The common snook is a protandric hermaphrodite fish species. Its spawning season spans from April to October. The peak spawning occurs during July and August. Spawning typically occurs in near-shore waters with high salinities. Following the spawning period, the juveniles then migrate to the brackish waters of the nearby estuarine environments.  When these juveniles mature, they return to the higher-salinity waters of the open ocean to join the breeding population. The common length is 50 cm.",
    "squid": "A squid is a mollusc with an elongated soft body, large eyes, eight arms, and two tentacles in the superorder Decapodiformes, though many other molluscs within the broader Neocoleoidea are also called squid despite not strictly fitting these criteria. Like all other cephalopods, squid have a distinct head, bilateral symmetry, and a mantle. They are mainly soft-bodied, like octopuses, but have a small internal skeleton in the form of a rod-like gladius or pen, made of chitin. Squid are rapid swimmers, moving by jet propulsion, and largely locate their prey by sight.  Squid can change colour for camouflage and signalling. Some species are bioluminescent, using their light for counter-illumination camouflage, while many species can eject a cloud of ink to distract predators.",
    "sweep": "The Scorpidinae, commonly known as halfmoons, knifefishes, and sweeps, are a subfamily of the family Kyphosidae, the sea chubs, a family of marine fish in the order Perciformes. The Scorpidinae are distributed throughout the Pacific and east Indian Oceans, with species occurring in the waters of North America, South America, Asia, Australia, and numerous islands. Most inhabit the continental shelf in shallow rock and kelp reefs and deeper offshore reefs, whilst others are found well offshore in a pelagic setting. Most of the Scorpidinae are carnivorous, taking a variety of small crustaceans, although some are partly herbivorous. A number of the larger species are fished commercially and recreationally, and are considered good table fish.",
    "tailor": "Bluefish are known as tailor in Australia and New Zealand, elf and shad in South Africa. It is a popular gamefish and food fish. The bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) is the only extant species of the family Pomatomidae. It is a marine pelagic fish found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean. The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail. The spiny first dorsal fin is normally folded back in a groove, as are its pectoral fins. Coloration is a grayish blue-green dorsally, fading to white on the lower sides and belly. Its single row of teeth in each jaw is uniform in size, knife-edged, and sharp. Bluefish commonly range in size from 18-cm \"snappers\" to much larger, sometimes weighing as much as 18 kg, though fish heavier than 9 kg are exceptional.",
    "tresher-shark": "Thresher sharks are large mackerel sharks of the family Alopiidae found in all temperate and tropical oceans of the world; the family contains three extant species, all within the genus Alopias. All three thresher shark species have been listed as vulnerable by the World Conservation Union since 2007 (IUCN). All three are popular big-game sport fish,and additionally they are hunted commercially for their meat, livers (for shark liver oil), skin (for shagreen) and fins (for use in delicacies such as shark-fin soup). Despite being active predatory fish, thresher sharks do not appear to be of threat to humans.",
    "trevally": "AMCS lists Trevally as BETTER CHOICE and Silver Trevally as THINK TWICE. Silver Trevally from both Corner Inlet, Vic and Port Phillip Bay, Vic have been assessed and recognised as a sustainable product by the Australian Conservation Foundation's 'Victorian Sustainable Seafood Assessment Project'. IUCN Redlist of Threatened Species lists Bigeye Trevally as 'Least Concern'. Forest & Bird (NZ) rank Silver Trevally D (AMBER - CONCERNS) in their Best Fish Guide Silver Trevally is sometimes sold as 'Silver Bream', a confusing mislabelling that inhibits the consumer's ability to make an informed purchasing choice. The Trevally's, of which there are at least 50 species in Australian waters, are unrelated to Blue-eye Trevalla and the Warehou family (including the Silver and Blue Warehou, often mislabelled as Trevally's) but are related to Samson Fish, Yellowtail Kingfish and Queenfish. They occur in schools in marine pelagic environments, mostly in Northern Australian waters. Mostly caught as bycatch of other fisheries, especially trawl but also including seine and gillnet fisheries.",
    "warehou": "Warehou is part of the Trevalla family. It is often mislabelled as Trevally, possibly to command higher market price. Be sure that you buy from a reputable fishmonger who can tell you specifically what species you are buying to avoid supporting unsustainable fisheries. It is also imported from New Zealand. May be sold under names that include Sea Bream, Trevally, Snotty Trevalla, Black Trevally, Tasmanian Trevally, Spotted Warehou, Silver Warehou and Warehou.",
    "pinkie-snapper": "The pinkie snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) or silver seabream is a species of porgie found in coastal waters of Australia, Philippines, Indonesia, mainland China, Taiwan, Japan and New Zealand. Its distribution areas in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are disjunct. Although it is almost universally known in Australia and New Zealand as snapper, it does not belong to the snapper family, Lutjanidae. It is highly prized as an edible fish, with a sweet sea taste and a firm texture.",

    "yellowtail-kingfish": "Also known as yellowtail amberjack,, hiramasa or great amberjack (Seriola lalandi) is a large fish found in the Southern Ocean. Although previously thought to be found in all oceans and seas, recent genetic analysis restricts S. lalandi proper to the Southern Hemisphere waters. However, they are found in Northern Hemisphere waters during certain times of the year. The fish was given its name by Monsieur de Lalande, a naturalist who first informed zoologist Achille Valenciennes of the existence of this species. His reason for the use of the word Seriola(feminine diminutive form of seria, a large earthenware pot) to name the fish is uncertain, but the second word lalandi was derived from his surname. These fish are now being farmed offshore in Maine."
